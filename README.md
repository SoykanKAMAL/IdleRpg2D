<h1>Design Choices</h1>

-Observer pattern: <br>
* Visual and functional code bodies are seperated. Functional code bodies work with or without the visual scripts and they are not aware if they exist or not. Visual and functional bodies comminucate only through events.<br>
* Code is easily extendible with the usage of events.<br><br>

-Singleton: <br>
* Managers implement singleton design pattern. Their static instances are reachable when needed.<br><br>

-State: <br>
* Main gameplay loop is handled by state pattern. Each state has unique code bodies executed within them.

<br><br> *All assets used are Free and their authors are credited in project folders.
